                                    <p>This repository contains the source code for the Linux kernel, which is the kernel used by the GNU/Linux operating system.</p>

                                    <h2 dir="auto">About</h2>
                                    <p>The Linux kernel is a free and open-source, monolithic, modular, multitasking, Unix-like operating system kernel. It was conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds for his i386-based PC, and it was soon adopted as the kernel for the GNU operating system, which was created as free software and developed under the GNU Project.</p>

                                    <p>Linux is deployed on a wide variety of computing systems, such as embedded devices, personal computers, servers, mainframes, and supercomputers.</p>

                                    <h2 dir="auto">Building</h2>
                                    <p>To build the kernel, you will need the GCC compiler, make, and other build tools. See the documentation in the Documentation/ directory for more information.</p>
