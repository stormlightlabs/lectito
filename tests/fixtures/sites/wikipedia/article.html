            <h1>Rust (programming language)</h1>
            <p><b>Rust</b> is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety—ensuring that all references point to valid memory—without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages.</p>

            <p>Rust was originally designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others. The designers refined the language while writing the Servo experimental browser engine, and the Rust compiler. It has seen significant adoption in the software industry.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The language grew out of a personal project begun in 2006 by Rust's creator, Graydon Hoare, who was a Mozilla employee at the time. Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009, and it was announced in 2010.</p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>Rust's design is focused on safety and control. It achieves memory safety without garbage collection through a system of ownership with borrowing and lifetime checking. It also provides pattern matching, algebraic data types, and other features associated with functional programming languages.</p>

            <h2>Syntax</h2>
            <p>Rust's syntax is similar to that of C and C++, though it has been influenced by other languages as well. Its code is organized into functions, which can be grouped into modules and crates.</p>

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>The classic "Hello, World!" program in Rust is:</p>
            <pre><code>fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}</code></pre>
